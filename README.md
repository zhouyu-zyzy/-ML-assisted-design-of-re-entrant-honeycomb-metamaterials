# Machine-learning-assisted design of re-entrant honeycomb metamaterials with tunable mechanical properties

'''
The repository consists of four main components: 
finite element simulations models, dataset, non-parametric models, and parametric models.
'''

# 1.FE
'''
Finite element simulations should be run using the Abaqus kernel, with version 2022 recommended for optimal compatibility.
DXF files can be generated using CAD software and imported into the Abaqus sketch module for finite element analysis.
'''

# 2.dataset
'''
The dataset includes both mechanical property data (dataset1) and stress–strain response data (dataset2).
'''

# 3.Non-parametric ML
'''
The non-parametric machine learning models include six conventional regression algorithms
and an integrated AutoEncoder–MLP framework. All models were implemented using Python3.9,
 and the detailed package versions are listed in the environment.txt file.
'''

# 4.Symbolic regression
'''
Due to considerations related to personal intellectual property, only partial results of the
symbolic regression model, specifically those for SEA, are presented.
